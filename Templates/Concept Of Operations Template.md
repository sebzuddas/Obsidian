>**The Concept of Operations (CONOPS/OSD)** *is produced early in the requirements definition process to describe what the system will do (not how it will do it) and why (rationale). It should also define any critical, top-level performance requirements or objectives (stated either qualitatively or quantitatively) and system rationale.*

# 1. Scope
## 1.1 Identification
>*This paragraph should contain a full identification of the capability/problem/system to which the CONOPS/OSD applies, including, as applicable, identification number(s), title(s), abbreviation(s), and version number(s). Where the system to which the CONOPS/OSD applies includes variants of the system, the above information should be provided for each variant.*
## 1.2 Background and Intended Use
> *This paragraph should briefly state the intended use of the system to which the CONOPS/OSD applies, relating it to any larger system, of which the system which is the subject of the CONOPS/OSD is to form a part. The paragraph should describe the general nature of the system, place the CONOPS/OSD in context of the history and future of the system, and identify relevant stakeholders, especially intended user(s).*

## 1.3 System Overview
> *This paragraph should summarize the conceptual solution of the system as described in the remainder of the CONOPS/OSD.*


## 1.4 Document Overview
>*This paragraph should summarize the purpose and contents of the CONOPS/OSD and should describe any security or privacy considerations associated with its use.*

# 2. Applicable and Reference Documents
>*This section should list the number, title, revision and date of each document referenced in the CONOPS/OSD. This section should also identify the source of each document not available through normal channels.*

## 2.1 Applicable Documents
>*This paragraph should list each document, which is invoked in whole or in part within the CONOPS/OSD as a part of the conceptual solution description.*

## 2.2 Other Referenced Documents
>*This paragraph should list each document which is referenced in the CONOPS/OSD but which does not comprise a part of the conceptual solution description.*

# 3. Definitions, Acronyms & Abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
>*This paragraph should list alphabetically and define each word or term used in the CONOPS/OSD for which reliance on dictionary definitions or usage in a relevant technical or user community is not appropriate. As a guide, terms which are not likely to be in the vocabulary of the intended users of the CONOPS/OSD, terms which have multiple dictionary meanings but only a single CONOPS/OSD meaning, specialist technical terms and terms which are used with special meanings should be defined in this paragraph. Alternatively, this paragraph may specify by name and issue a suitable technical dictionary or other reference publication to be used in the interpretation of terms used in the CONOPS/OSD and which meets the criteria above for definition of terms.*

## 3.2 Acronyms
>*This section should list alphabetically each acronym used in the document, together with the acronym’s expanded meaning.*

## 3.3 Abbreviations
>*This section should list alphabetically each abbreviation used in the document, together with the abbreviation’s expanded meaning, except that abbreviations within the International System (SI) system of units should not be listed.*


# 4. System-wide Solution Concepts
>*This section should be divided into paragraphs as needed to present system-wide conceptual solution decisions (if any), that is: 
>a. conceptual solution decisions affecting the selection and specification of solution elements, and 
>b. decisions about the system's behavioral conceptual solution (how the system will behave, from a user’s point of view, in meeting its requirements, consistent with but in more detail than the requirements, and ignoring internal implementation. 
>
>Examples of system-wide conceptual solution decisions are: 
>a. conceptual solution decisions relating to common personnel, hardware, software, interfaces within the decision envelope permitted by requirements and as influenced by any goals; 
>b. other system-wide conceptual solution decisions made in response to requirement and as influenced by any goals, such as selected approaches to providing availability, configurability, flexibility, reliability, safety security and sustainability. 
>
>Solution description conventions needed to understand the CONOPS/OSD should also be presented or referenced.

# 5. System Operational Solution Concept
>*The paragraph titles and numbering below, of 5.1 to 5.5, may be departed from if desired, to better suit the nature of the system, provided that the information as specified is presented in a clear and logical way.*

## 5.1 Identification of System Elements
> *This paragraph should identify the solution elements of the system (hardware, software, human, procedural) serving a direct operational (use) purpose. Naturally occurring elements used as a part of the solution should be included.*

## 5.2 Implementation Intentions of System Elements
>*This paragraph should describe, typically in table format, the implementation intentions for each system element. Example implementation intentions are: 
>a. Development by company 
>b. Development by contractor 
>c. Existing – owned by company 
>d. Existing – to be purchased 
>e. Existing – fee for use 
>f. Existing organization. Procedures will need revision. Staff will need training. 
>g. Existing – will need configuration 
>h. Minor modification to existing item 
>i. Naturally occurring.



| System Element | Element Relationship to Other Elements | Implementation Intentions |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Database      | Many(fill out)                              | Existing, by company      |
|                |                                        |                           |


## 5.3 Overview of Operations
>*This paragraph should show the static relationships of the elements, especially the “is connected to” relationships, with major flows across connections (interfaces) shown.

## 5.4 Role of Each Element
>*This paragraph should describe for each element in alphabetical order, the role in the overall operational solution that the element plays, describing as necessary its interoperation with other elements.*

## 5.5 System Logical Concept
>*This paragraph should, to the degree applicable: 
>a. describe at a conceptual level of detail, the functional concept of solution in terms of a set of functions, related hierarchically to use-related system functional requirements, such that, at the lowest level(s) of functions in the hierarchy, each function is able to be allocated for its performance to a single system element listed in 5.1; 
>b. describe the logical sequence and concurrency in which functions are to be performed, together with the logic of any conditional relationships between functions; 
>c. describe the interfaces and associated flows of items (information, physical items, forces, supplies, continuous flows of liquids or gasses, etc.) between functions; 
>d. associate with each allocatable function the applicable set of key performance characteristics; 
>e. relate allocatable functions to states and modes of the system, where such relationships exist.*
