>**Definition of System Specification:**Â *A type of program-unique specification that describes the requirements and verification of the requirements for a combination of elements that must function together to produce the capabilities required to fulfil a mission need, including hardware, equipment, software, or any combination thereof.

#Requirements #Project
# System Purpose
The purpose of the system is to demonstrate time innovatively, via kinematics and a digital display. The system shall demonstrate year, season, month, week, day, hour, minute and second. The system intends to extend a clock's functionality in a way that is engaging, innovative and dynamic. 
# General System Requirements

## Major Capabilities
1. System must be operational 24/7
2. System must be connected to the internet 24/7
3. System must be connected to power 24/7
4. System must have a kinematic element. 
5. System must intuitively and easily display the current moment in the context of a year. 
## Major Conditions
eg:
1. System must be easily interpretable. 
2. System must be silent during operation. 
3. 
## System Interfaces
eg:
1. System must be visually appealing
2. System must visualise time. 
3. Mechanical systems are to visualise up to three aspects of time in the context of a year. 
4. System must be remotely updatable.
	1. System must operate on user network. 

## User Characteristics
>*Who is the user? Identify the user of the system through function, location, device type. Specify the number of users.*

The user is an average person who wants to tell the time, but place time in a wider context, as opposed to solely the day. The objective is for the user to gain a wider perspective of time. The user shall use the system in their own home, with no consideration for water.
