>**Definition of System Specification:**Â *A type of program-unique specification that describes the requirements and verification of the requirements for a combination of elements that must function together to produce the capabilities required to fulfil a mission need, including hardware, equipment, software, or any combination thereof.

#Requirements #Template 



# System Purpose
The purpose of such a system is to make the house 'smart'. The goal is to have a house that collects sensor data from all the rooms, and where it is possible to actuate, have automated actuation systems that complement everyday living.  
# General System Requirements

## Major Capabilities
eg:
1. System must be operational 24/7
2. System must be connected to the LAN 24/7
3. System must have the capacity to link to the internet when needed. 
4. System must be able to track electricity consumption. 
5. System must be able to track gas consumption. 
## Major Conditions
eg:
1. System must use x document framework
2. System must interface with x API
## System Interfaces
eg:
1. System must interface with user through app
2. System must be accessible through an API
3. HAOS must interface with other computers within the network. 

## User Characteristics
*Who is the user? Identify the user of the system through function, location, device type. Specify the number of users.*

The maximum number of users is the family unit. At minimum one person, and the assumed maximum is the number of bedrooms of the house * 2. The user is an average homeowner, with access to the relevant technology to be able to adapt and add things on to the [[home automation]] [[System|system]] 

# Policy & Regulation Requirements
*Specify relevant applicable laws, regulations, policies and standards that will affect the operation and performance of the system. Include relevant external regulation.*
