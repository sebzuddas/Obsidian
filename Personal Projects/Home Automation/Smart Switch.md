# System Purpose

To be able to integrate this within a typical houses' light switches, meaning the user retains manual control of the lights, whilst simultaneously providing a convenient way to capture sensor data at discrete points within the house. Such an approach prevents the need to use batteries or plug sensors into mains plugs, allowing for a continuous and reliable flow of data during use. 
# General System Requirements

## Major Capabilities
eg:
1. System must be operational 24/7
2. System must be connected to the internet 24/7
3. System must be able to handle [[UK Mains Electricity]]. 
4. System must be able to transmit data wirelessly to Home Assistant
5. System must be rated to operate safely over many years, and contain failsafe mechanisms:
	1. Prevent fire by design
	2. Enable switch to be used in the case of circuit failure. 
6. 
## Major Conditions
eg:
1. System must use x document framework
2. System must be able to transmit data to HomeAssistant. 
3. System must be able to display information on the phone. 
4. Sensor readings must be reasonable, with sensors exposed to the room. 
5. Sensors must include:
	1. [[Carbon Dioxide Sensor]]
	2. [[PM2.5 Sensor]]
	3. [[PM10 Sensor]]
	4. [[Volatile Organic Compound Sensor]]
	5. [[Temperature Sensor]]
	6. [[Humidity Sensor]]
	7. [[Passive Infra-red Sensor]]?
	8. 

## System Interfaces
eg:
1. Data transferred by the system must be available through HomeAssistant. 
2. Must interface with home mains power, and not be battery powered.
