# Project Aims
The aim of the project is to modify a pushbike to collect, process, store, and display data gathered from a cycling trip. The data collected will be related to human performance, the bike itself, and the environment surrounding the bike. The overall goal is to track a cyclist and create software and hardware that would facilitate a 'smart bike'. The data will be integrated between the cyclist and the bike, enabling insights into the trip and more. 

# Objectives
1. The primary objective is to deliver a project using a systems engineering approach. 
	1. Requirements gathering.
	2. System Design.
	3. System Development.
	4. System Integration.
	5. Validation (meet system requirements)
	6. Verification (meet stakeholder requirements)
2. Investigate 'smart' solutions on other mobility media.
	1. Smart cars.
	2. 
3. Create a system architecture that facilitates the integration of data, remotely, between a smart bike and a cyclist. 
	1. Develop an overall system architecture.
	2. Develop an architecture for software subsystems.
	3. Develop an architecture for hardware subsystems. 
	4. Develop a CAD model of the bike.
	5. (Stretch) Integrate data and CAD model via a Digital Twin. 
4. (Stretch) Develop near real-time tracking of the bike using GIS data. 
5. (Stretch) Implement a form of control or prediction.

# System Requirements
Writing a good requirements document is essential to ensure a system with the intended final function is delivered. Here is a website outlining the writing of [good requirements](https://www.nasa.gov/seh/appendix-c-how-to-write-a-good-requirement):
