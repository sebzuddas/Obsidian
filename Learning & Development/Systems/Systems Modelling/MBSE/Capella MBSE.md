Capella is an MBSE tool that assists the user in going through the whole [[Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)]] process. 

# Innovation With Capella Course
## Why Capella?
Capella helps you identify opportunities to innovate. Sustained innovation is the goal, and Capella helps that happen. It does this by employing the ARCitecture Analysis & Design Integrated Approach (ARCADIA) method. ARCADIA helps you understand the problem, and define what parts of the problem you need to address. In helping define the problem, communication of the problem becomes easier to other parts of an organisation, including non experts.

## Operational Analysis
Operational analysis will help you understand the problem you wish to solve by modeling the problem. 

An Operational **Capability** blank diagram depicts the capabilities the users expect. In this, Capella depicts Actors and Entities through a modelling notation. Capella also depicts Operational Capabilities in a modelling notation. 

An Operational **Activity** diagram will deliver the capabilities with Operational Process. In this context, Capella depicts **Actors** and **Entities** that delier **Functions**. These functions when combined become **Functional Chains** to deliver capabilities.
